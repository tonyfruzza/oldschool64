# A Multimedia Introduction to How Computers Work on C64
A slide show demoed to kindergarteners on the basic workings of a computer. Not limited to 8bit, but this application runs only on a Commodore 64.

## Usage
Once compiled load `cool.prg` or the disk version containing the binary in `cool.d64` on your Commodore 64 or emulator. Use game port 2 and the left and right direction to navigate the slides.

## Tools Used
If you have the following tools in the same location as mine on OS X then the provided `Makefile` will build the application for you. Aart's compiler is most similar to 64tass.
* Compile using [Aart Bik's 6502 assembler](https://www.aartbik.com/retro.php)
* Vice tools to create a D64 disk image

The static slides were initially created using [Petmate](https://nurpax.github.io/petmate/)
